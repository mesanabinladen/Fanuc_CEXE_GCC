/* Definition file of common variables between tasks.(optional)
Defines the variables which can be accessed from all tasks.
Be sure to define only the variables, but not the functions.
The defined DRAM variables must have the initial values. The initial values are
necessary to allocate the variables into the DRAM area, and are not effective
when the application program actually runs. When you set the initial values for
the DRAM variables, you should add an initial value setting process to the
application program. */
